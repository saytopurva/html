            Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
            will later be filled with 'real' content. This is resquired when, for example, the final text is not yet
            available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
            texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy
            texts have been in use by typesetters since the 16th century.
